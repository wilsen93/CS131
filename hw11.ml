(* Write a function convert_grammar gram1 that returns a Homework 2-style grammar, 
 which is converted from the Homework 1-style grammar gram1. Test your implementation 
 of convert_grammar on the test grammars given in Homework 1. For example, the top-level
 definition let awksub_grammar_2 = convert_grammar awksub_grammar should bind awksub_grammar_2 
 to a Homework 2-style grammar that is equivalent to the Homework 1-style grammar awksub_grammar. *)

(* Write a function parse_prefix gram that returns a matcher for the grammar gram. 
 When applied to an acceptor accept and a fragment frag, the matcher must return the 
 first acceptable match of a prefix of frag, by trying the grammar rules in order; 
 this is not necessarily the shortest nor the longest acceptable match. A match is 
 considered to be acceptable if accept succeeds when given a derivation and the suffix 
 fragment that immediately follows the matching prefix. When this happens, the matcher 
 returns whatever the acceptor returned. If no acceptable match is found, the matcher returns None. *)
